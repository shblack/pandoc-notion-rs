//! Pandoc to Notion conversion utilities
//!
//! This module provides tools for converting Pandoc document elements
//! to Notion API data structures, enabling the transformation of Pandoc's
//! Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into Notion's rich text objects.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - Convert Pandoc inline elements to Notion rich text objects
//! - Preserve text formatting (bold, italic, strikethrough, underline, code)
//! - Support mathematical expressions
//! - Handle hyperlinks and URL references
//! - Preserve whitespace and line breaks
//! - Convert Pandoc spans with CSS classes to Notion colors
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The conversion process uses a chain of responsibility pattern with element
//! handlers that each know how to convert a specific type of Pandoc element.
//! A TextBuilder helps construct Notion rich text objects with the appropriate
//! formatting.
