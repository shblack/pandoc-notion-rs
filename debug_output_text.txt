# Medical Note

### Subjective

I evaluated Mr. Stiff today for acute respiratory distress. The patient
reports feeling unwell since this morning, with progressive worsening of
his breathing. He was initially on 3 liters of oxygen with an oxygen
saturation of 80%, which prompted me to increase to 6 liters. The
patient has a history of hypercapnic respiratory failure with previous
IMC (Intermediate Care) admissions. When questioned about the onset of
symptoms, he indicated they began this morning after having an "okay"
night. I noted his condition has deteriorated compared to yesterday's
assessment.

### Physical Exam

- Respiratory: Moving "pretty good air" with no significant wheezing
  heard
- Cardiovascular: Heart murmur present, tachycardia noted
- Oxygen: Initially 80% on 3L, increased to 6L, then adjusted to 4L,
  then 3L
- Mental status: Alert and oriented despite hypercapnia
- ABG results: 7, 3, 6, 80, 69 - patient is hypercapnic but reasonably
  compensated

### Plan

- Chest X-ray ordered and completed
- EKG ordered
- ABG completed - shows hypercapnia with reasonable compensation
- Consider short trial of BiPAP (patient reportedly uses nocturnal BiPAP
  at home)
- Anticipate transfer to IMC (Intermediate Care) unit
- Respiratory treatments (previously administered)
- Continue oxygen therapy with titration based on response

### Physical Exam

Gen: Patient appears in respiratory distress, using accessory muscles of
respiration, stated he does not feel well  
Neuro: Alert and oriented x3  
CV: Tachycardic, heart murmur present  
Pulm: Decreased breath sounds at bases, using accessory muscles of
respiration, unable to complete full sentences  
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds heard

### Hospital Course

Mr. Stith is a 73-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including
COPD on 3L NC and nocturnal CPAP requiring IMC admissions for
respiratory failure, thoracic aortic aneurysm s/p stent, CAD s/p
angiogram (2022), HTN, HLD, HFpEF, anxiety disorder (particularly
nocturnal), who presented due to shortness of breath. He was admitted to
observation for exacerbated dyspnea in the background of chronic hypoxic
and hypercapnic respiratory failure. On examination, he was comfortable
on his baseline 3L nasal cannula oxygen, speaking in full sentences,
with mild bibasilar wheezing. He described difficulty operating his home
CPAP device and attributed his morning dyspnea to this issue. Treatment
included nocturnal CPAP initiation and empiric COPD exacerbation
treatment with IV steroids.

During his stay, he developed chest pain with anxiety and AFib RVR. He
underwent CT dissection protocol (negative), was placed on Amiodarone
gtt, and given IV lorazepam. Patient experienced temporary altered
mental status after receiving 2mg IV lorazepam instead of the ordered
1mg, requiring flumazenil administration. He subsequently developed
delirium with agitation requiring restraints briefly. The AFib RVR has
since resolved with amiodarone.

The patient was initially medically stabilized, but discharge planning
was complicated when his assisted living facility declined his return.
He was subsequently accepted by a new assisted living facility however
logistics of this transfer are apparently delayed.

He then developed fluctuating delirium with malaise, delayed rise in
WBCs not attributable to steroids, and periodic borderline hypotension
of uncertain etiology, prompting initiation of empiric antibiotics
pending negative blood cultures. Today (HD 8), patient experienced acute
respiratory distress with oxygen desaturation to 80% on his baseline 3L
NC, requiring escalation to 6L NC. ABG showed compensated hypercapnia.
Chest x-ray revealed worsening bilateral pleural effusions and perihilar
congestion compared to previous imaging. Given clinical deterioration,
patient is being transferred to IMC for closer monitoring and possible
BiPAP therapy.

### Assessment and Plan

## Active Medical Issues

73M admitted with respiratory distress, now with acute respiratory
deterioration requiring increased O2 support from baseline 3L to 6L NC.
History significant for COPD, CAD, and chronic hypoxic/hypercapnic
respiratory failure. Current ABG shows compensated hypercapnia with O2
sat 80%. CXR reveals worsening bilateral pleural effusions.

## Respiratory Deterioration

Acute worsening of respiratory status likely multifactorial: possible
CHF exacerbation (given CXR findings), COPD component, and potential
underlying infection. Patient requires IMC transfer for closer
monitoring.

- Transfer to IMC for higher level of care
- Trial BiPAP given home use and current respiratory status
- Obtain repeat ABG in 1-2 hours post intervention
- Consider diuresis if evidence of fluid overload

## Suspected Infection

Leukocytosis trending down (16â†’14) but persistent, combined with
respiratory deterioration and recent AFib RVR raises concern for
underlying infection.

- Continue empiric Zosyn pending culture results
- Monitor WBC trend and inflammatory markers
- Assess need for expanded coverage based on clinical response

## Cardiovascular Status

Recent AFib with RVR now resolved on amiodarone. High CHA2DS2-VASc score
requires continued anticoagulation.

- Continue Eliquis 5mg BID
- Maintain amiodarone 200mg daily
- Monitor for rhythm recurrence given respiratory deterioration

## Disposition Planning

Pending:

- Stabilization of respiratory status in IMC
- Completion of antibiotic course
- Resolution of leukocytosis
- Finalization of Medicaid waiver for new assisted living facility
