# Sample Rich Text Formatting

## Text Styling Examples

This paragraph demonstrates **bold text** formatting which is great for *emphasizing* important points. You can also combine **_bold and italic_** formatting for stronger emphasis.

Sometimes you need to ~~strike through~~ text to show it's no longer relevant. Although standard Markdown doesn't support underlining, some processors render <u>underlined text</u> with HTML tags.

When referring to code elements like `function()` or `variables`, you should use inline code formatting.

## Mathematical Expressions

Einstein's famous equation $E=mc^2$ demonstrates the relationship between energy and mass. Another interesting equation is the Pythagorean theorem $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

For economics, the formula $PV = \frac{FV}{(1+r)^n}$ calculates present value.

## Combined Formatting

You can **combine _different_ ~~styles~~ `together`** to create *complex [formatting](https://example.com)* when needed.

The velocity formula $v = \frac{d}{t}$ is *important* in **physics**.
